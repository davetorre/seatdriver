I used the Web Audio API and [this scheduling method](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/) to make a drum machine that plays along with a song I wrote and uses the drum sounds from that song. Users can change the song's drum beat on the fly while listening. Try it out [here](http://davetorre.com/play-alongs/seatdriver/index.html).
